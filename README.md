Game "Find a pair"<p>
The page contains a playing field measuring 4 by 4 squares, painted white. For 16 squares, 8 pairs of different colors are randomly generated. When a player clicks on one of the cells, it is painted in a certain color. The essence of the game is to open 2 cells of the same color. After clicking on the cell (if the colors of the cells coincided) - the colors do not sell anywhere, but if you made a mistake, then both squares turn back to white.
The goal of the game is to find pairs for all cells, thereby completely coloring the playing field. After finding the last pair, a pop-up window appears with information about the end of the game and the time spent on it.
